          <p>
            With more than 15 years of experience, I currently work at Squarespace as a Design Manager. Previously, I was a Senior Art Director at Huge Inc.
          </p>
          <p>
            At Squarespace, my primary role is to lead the design efforts of our Visual Design team. Our tasks range from designing and custom building all pages of our front site (squarespace.com), developing standalone microsites for a variety of subjects including our seasonal campaigns, and creating bespoke websites for high-profile customers. I also help oversee the work of other visual designs in our org, including some of our branding projects, installations, and events.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Visual Design team is responsible for the quality and consistency of our brand and look and feel, and we ensure that all facets of our company and product offerings are properly communicated to our customers and website visitors. Our team works closely with various departments of the company, including Marketing, Strategy, the Template and Product Design teams, and Engineering, as well as product owners, stakeholders, and executive leadership.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a Design Manager, a big part of my job is to set a good foundation and create the right environment for people to do their best work, which I’ve aimed to do in part by establishing team regroups, brainstorm sessions, design critiques, and show and tell sessions. I’m also responsible for team mentorship and development, which I’ve focused on heavily in this role. I’m always looking to remove blockers for my team by collaborating and negotiating priorities with stakeholders, clarifying issues, selling work to leadership, and making sure that our projects are delivered with a high level of polish—and on time. Lastly, I've led the comp reviews and performance feedback of my direct reports, of which I currently have six.
          </p>
          <p>
            I am also heavily involved with recruiting and team building. Over the past two years, I’ve helped interview hundreds of candidates, and was directly involved in the hiring of more than 20 team members, including Designers, Developers, Project Managers, Producer, Copywriters, and more.
